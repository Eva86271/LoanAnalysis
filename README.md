This was done as a solution provider for the Analytics Vidya Competition.

The data was studied and errors such like outliers,missing values,inappropriate values were cleaned for the prediction. After the processing steps few relations were studied and the model was build on the data .
A boosting model was chosen to showcase the robustness as they learn from the lagging errors. The final model was classifying with an accuracy of 80.5%.
